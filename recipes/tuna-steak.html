    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tuna steak recipe is impressive enough for company, but surprisingly easy to make.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) tuna steaks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix orange juice, soy sauce, olive oil, parsley, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and pepper together in a large non-reactive dish until well combined. Place tuna steaks in marinade and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove tuna steaks from the marinade and shake off excess; reserve marinade for basting.</li>
        <li>Cook tuna steaks on the preheated grill for 5 to 6 minutes; flip steaks and baste with reserved marinade. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or to desired doneness. Discard any remaining marinade.</li>
    </ol>
